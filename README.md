### Project Description
The Vada Analyzer is a gloriously useless, AI-powered Flutter app that takes a photo of your vada, analyzes its hole size, symmetry, and overall structural integrity, and then roasts it with scientifically inaccurate but emotionally devastating insults. Now with an audio feedback feature, it doesn‚Äôt just judge your snack silently ‚Äî it speaks its verdict aloud, so everyone around you can also question your vada-making skills.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We‚Äôre solving the world‚Äôs most overlooked crisis: the lack of a standardized, scientific method to judge the aesthetic and acoustic qualities of vadas.For far too long, vadas have been made without accountability ‚Äî holes too small, shapes resembling distant planets, and zero auditory feedback when insulted.
The Vada Analyzer ensures no vada escapes judgment, both visually and verbally, finally bringing justice to fried snack quality control that nobody actually needed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Flutter-powered, AI-enhanced, hole-obsessed snack critic that uses the Imagga API to scan your vada like it‚Äôs applying for a passport photo.
It measures the hole size with surgical precision, rates symmetry like a grumpy geometry teacher, and then roasts it with customized insults.
To add insult to‚Ä¶ snack, it now speaks these judgments out loud, so your entire kitchen (and possibly neighbors) can hear how your vada has failed to meet the International Standards of Roundness‚Ñ¢.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

- Languages used: Dart

- Frameworks used: Flutter

- Libraries used:

  http ‚Äì for making API requests to Imagga

  flutter_tts ‚Äì for text-to-speech functionality

  image_picker ‚Äì for selecting images from device storage or camera

- Tools used:

  Imagga API ‚Äì for image recognition and analysis

  VS Code / Android Studio ‚Äì for development and debugging

  Git & GitHub ‚Äì for version control and collaboration





### Implementation
For Software:

The Vada Analyzer is implemented using Flutter, which enables building a single codebase that compiles to native apps on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Web, and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).

The user selects or captures a photo of the vada using the device‚Äôs camera or gallery (via image_picker).

The app sends the image to the Imagga API through HTTP requests for image analysis.

The API responds with data about the image, such as detected features and labels related to the vada‚Äôs shape and holes.

The app processes this data to calculate hole size and symmetry metrics.

The results are displayed visually on the screen and optionally read out loud using the device‚Äôs text-to-speech engine (flutter_tts).

Because Flutter compiles to native code or JavaScript (for web), the app works seamlessly across devices without separate implementations for each platform.


# Installation
- Option 1: Install from APK (Android)
             
    
    Download the latest APK from the Releases section on GitHub.

    On your Android device, enable Install from Unknown Sources (if not already enabled).

     Open the downloaded APK file and follow the prompts to install.

   Launch the app and start analyzing your vadas!

- Option 2: Run from Source (PC or Mobile)  

  Prerequisites: 

  Install Flutter SDK  
  Set up your device/emulator or use a web browser
